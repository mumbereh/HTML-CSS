                        <h4>What is Ruby?</h4>
                        <p >Ruby is an open-source object-oriented scripting language invented in 
                            the mid-90s by Yukihiro Matsumoto.
                        </p>
                            <p> Unlike languages such as C and C++, a scripting language doesn’t talk
                                directly to hardware. It’s written to a text file and then parsed by an 
                                interpreter and turned into code. These programs are generally procedural 
                                in nature, meaning they are read from top to bottom.</p>
                            
                            <p>Object-oriented languages, on the other hand, break out pieces of code into 
                                objects that can be created and used as needed. You can reuse these objects 
                                in other parts of the program, or even other applications.
                            </p> 
                            
                            <p>Yukihiro wanted to create a scripting language that leveraged 
                                object-oriented programming and increase code reuse to help speed 
                                up development. And so the Ruby programming language was born, 
                                using simple language and syntax to handle data and logic to solve problems.
                            </p>

                        <h4>JavaScript?</h4>
                        <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex 
        features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display 
        static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps,
        animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is
        probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies,
        two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning
